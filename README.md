### Assignment 1 - Memory Allocation

In addition to helping us refresh our memory on the C++ language, this
assignment helps us have a better understanding of memory management
and memory allocation, which are some of the main tasks of Operating
Systems.

In this implementation, we first initialized the structure of two arrays: an array
of integers that represent the sizes of the char arrays, and the pointers to the
char arrays. After initializing the structure, the user has four options: accessing
a pointer, listing deallocated memory, deallocating all memory, and exiting
the program.
